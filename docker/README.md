## General-concepts
| word | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Daemon | Is running in the background |
|Images | Is an immutable file that contains the source code, libraries, dependecies, tools, and other files needed for an aplication to run |
| Containers | Is a runnable instance of an image you can create, start, stop, move, or delete |

> [more information about docker architecture](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/#docker-architecture)

## Get-start

### Hello-world
```
 $ docker run hello-world
 Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
 latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
 0e03bdcc26d7: Pull complete 
 Digest: sha256:31b9c7d48790f0d8c50ab433d9c3b7e17666d6993084c002c2ff1ca09b96391d
 Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

 Hello from Docker!

```
### Basic-docker-commands
| commands | Description |
| --- | --- |
|`docker pull <name-image>` | Is used yo download an image. |
|`docker images` | Shows images we have downloaded. |
|`docker rmi <name-image/image-id>` | It is to remove the image. |
|`docker ps -a`| Shows the containers/images that are executed. |
|`docker ps`| Displays containers/images in daemon mode. |
|`docker stop <names/container-id>` | stops the execution of containers/images. |
|`docker rm <name/container-id>`| It is to delete the execution history. |

> Be careful if you want to delete an image or its execution history, you would have to stop the execution and then delete it from its history and then it could delete the image. there is a way to remove it with a `-f` flag more details on how to use below.

### Useful-flags-to-get-started
Flags in docker have their full mode and short mode.
They can be identified as follows: `--all` or `-a`

| flags | Description |
| --- | --- |
|`-h` | has a general use it will show you all the options that the command has.|
|`-q` | Only display container IDs|
|`docker <rm/rmi> -f` | Is use to forcibly remove |

### Tricks-combined-with-linux-command

| Commands | Description |
| --- | --- |
|`| grep <keyword>` | To filter|
|`$()` | Command substitution allows the output of a command to replace the command itself | 

#### Examples
1 grep
```
[senixcode@localhost challenge-upload-learned-github]$ docker images 
REPOSITORY    TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE

[senixcode@localhost challenge-upload-learned-github]$ docker images | grep mon

```
2 $(), this will delete all history
```
[senixcode@localhost challenge-upload-learned-github]$ docker ps -a
